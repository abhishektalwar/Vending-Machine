# Vending-Machine
Coding Exercise for Vending Machine


The coding challenge aims at designing a vending machine with the following assumptions:-
1. Able to view the vending machine menu, select an item, and pay/receive change.
2. Assume you can give change in [5, 10, 25, 100, 200] cent coin denominations (Canadian currency of nickel, dime, quarter, 1 dollar coin, 2 dollar coin)
3. Assume initial menu of {'CandyBar':200, ‘Chips’:150, ‘Soda’:100}
4. Assume people can pay with standard Canadian currency

In order to run the program on your machine, Python 3.7 or later needs to be installed. Once the Vending-Machine repository is downloaded from Github, the code can be run using the main.py file.
